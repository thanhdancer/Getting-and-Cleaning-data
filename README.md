# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The project involves the following steps:
1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
